The model originally used for this version had the following details:
 * Input shape = (1,50,1,3)
 * Output shape = (1,)

When trying to run this model on Arduino, it became evident that the input
and output shapes naturally used in Tensorflow lite micro were (1,None)
 * In other words, they were 2d arrays

There was no issue with output, but the input needed to be changed to be 2d
 * Since there's no way to reshape a buffer in arduino (without external libraries),
   this meant we had to retrain the model with the proper new input

All it required was:
 * Changing the model training generators to match the new shape
 * Changing the "Input", first layer in the model to be (1, 50*1*3)
 * Then adding in a new "Reshape" layer as a second layer in order to get
   the desired (1,50,1,3)
